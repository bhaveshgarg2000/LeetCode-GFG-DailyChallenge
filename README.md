# Daily LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks Practice

Welcome to my daily coding practice repository! Here, I document my journey of solving daily coding challenges from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. This repository serves as both a record of my progress and a resource for others looking to enhance their problem-solving skills.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this repository is to:

- Sharpen my problem-solving skills by consistently practicing coding challenges.
- Document my progress and track improvements over time.
- Share knowledge and solutions with the community to facilitate learning and collaboration.

## Structure

### LeetCode

- Each LeetCode problem is organized into its own directory under the `LeetCode` folder.
- Within each problem directory, you'll find:
  - The problem statement (`problem.md` or `README.md`).
  - My solution(s) in various programming languages (`leetcode.cpp`).

### GeeksforGeeks (GFG)

- Similar to LeetCode, each GFG problem is structured within its own directory under the `GeeksforGeeks` folder.
- Each problem directory contains:
  - The problem description (`problem.md` or `README.md`).
  - My solution(s) in different programming languages (`solution.cpp`).

#### Note: 
All solutions are implemented in C++ unless stated otherwise.
